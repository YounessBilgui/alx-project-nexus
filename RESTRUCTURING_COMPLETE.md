# API: http://localhost:8000/api/
# Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Use the setup script
./setup.sh

# Or manual setup
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd backend
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
cd backend
python manage.py test ../tests/

# Specific test categories
python manage.py test tests.test_models
python manage.py test tests.test_api
python manage.py test tests.test_performance
```

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Update Remote Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Restructure project to professional standards"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Set Up CI**
   - Push to GitHub to trigger automated workflows
   - Monitor build and test results in Actions tab
   - Review security scanning reports

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
   - Set up production environment variables
   - Configure database and Redis connections

4. **Deploy to Production**
